# Overview

dblockchain is an umbrella project of references to blockchain and cryptocurrency related projects written in D.  Anyone is welcome to join this initiative.  We feel that dlang is a great choice for blockchain related projects.  With access to then entire C and C++ ecosystem, large amounts of code can be re-used under the umbrella of D.  D should offer advantages in performance, speed of development, and solid technical ecosystem, plus we have good access to the creators of the D language, which is unusual to be able to say for a programming language.  Because Cryptocurrency is booming right now, it has captured a lot of time and attention of developers.  Most cryptocurrency projects on Github are currently written in C++ (many forks of the same code exist for Ethereum and Bitcoin).  A few projects have chosen Go as the primary language (Decred, Ethereum).  Other projects are focus on implementation of reference platforms, and so Javascript/Node.js is the natural choice.  We believe D has an opportunity to assert itself as a viable platform and community for what we hope to be some major new opens ource development projects.

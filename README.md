# Overview

blockchain-d is an umbrella project of references to blockchain and cryptocurrency related projects written in D.  Anyone is welcome to join this initiative.  We feel that dlang is a great choice for blockchain related projects.  With access to then entire C and C++ ecosystem, large amounts of code can be re-used under the umbrella of D.  D should offer advantages in performance, speed of development, and solid technical ecosystem, plus we have good access to the creators of the D language, which is unusual to be able to say for a programming language.  Because Cryptocurrency is booming right now, it has captured a lot of time and attention of developers.  Most cryptocurrency projects on Github are currently written in C++ (many forks of the same code exist for Ethereum and Bitcoin).  A few projects have chosen Go as the primary language (Decred, Ethereum).  Other projects are focus on implementation of reference platforms, and so Javascript/Node.js is the natural choice.  We believe D has an opportunity to assert itself as a viable platform and community for what we hope to be some major new opens ource development projects.

## Projects

### Blockchains

- The Shell Project: The Shell Project (working name) aims to build a viable general purpose blockchain, with attributes of security, ease of deployment, clear specification, ease of use for DAPPs, and multiple implementation interop.  Since the focus is on generalized use cases, not specifically cryptocurrency, it becomes possible for others to adapt this to their own use cases.  The goal is to keep this project pure OSS, although it is associated with a business entity.  We don't care who uses it, forks it, distributes it.  And we don't intend to file patents on anything that has the intent of requiring commercial licensing or targetted patent trolling.  The first implemetnation would be in Dlang.  We will be working with another developer to ensure at least one other blockchain implementation is built in Java.  Read more: https://github.com/IoTone/TheShellProject
